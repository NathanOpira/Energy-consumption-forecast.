# Energy Consumption Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `models/`: Stores trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.
- `outputs/`: Contains output files such as predictions and evaluation metrics.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the scripts or notebooks to preprocess data, engineer features, train models, and evaluate results.
